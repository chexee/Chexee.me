I made my first website when I was thirteen. Several Neopets fansites hosted on Geocities later, I found myself blogging about my vapid teenage life to an audience of strangers. I set up Greymatter (and later WordPress) to tell the entire internet what I had to say.

As it turns out, my life really wasn’t that exciting.

I became much more enamored with the process of designing and building my blog than actually writing in it. Every few weeks it would sport a new look – changing colors, fonts, and themes almost as often as posts would appear.

When I hit college, I made an life-changing discovery: I could make a career out of obsessively creating things on the web. I haven’t stopped learning since.
